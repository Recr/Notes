The remote command has the purpose of setting the options for a remote repository.
For example, to add a remote repository from [[GitHub]] we could use this command.
```git
git remote add origin https://github.com/User/Repository.git
```
With that, we would be adding a remote repository called origin that is stored in the passed link.
