```git clone``` is a command to clone an existing repository locally.
We usually use the command followed by the link of the repository
```git
git clone https://github.com/User/Repository.git
```

With this command the repository will be cloned locally in a folder with the same same. But this name can be changed if necessary with the same command, but now followed by the desired name.
```git
git clone https://github.com/User/Repository.git Repository-name
```
