Git commit command records changes to the repository.

We can change the message in a commit using the following command:
```git
git commit --ammend -m "your message here"
```

or also

```git
git commit --ammend 
```
Which will open your selected text editor to make the changes you want.

If instead of just changing the commit's message, it's necessary to delete it completely, the [[Git Reset|git reset]] command will be used.
